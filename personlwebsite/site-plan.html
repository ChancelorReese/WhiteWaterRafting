        Engagements
        Congratulations!!! You are engaged and you have so much to plan and prepare for! -let's simplify the process and prep for those wedding invites by getting some professional pictures taken of the bride and groom-to-be. Normally these are 1-hour sessions with the couple, with 2 locations of your choice.
        Engagement Session = $200

        Bridals / Formals
        Make the wedding day smoother and easier by getting your formal pictures (Like the first look, just the bride/just the groom, and all the posses with just the couple) out of the way. This allows you to have pictures of yourself in your dress and suit displayed at a reception/celebration on your wedding day. Formals will take about 2-3 hours that can be split between multiple locations of your choice.
        Bridals/Formals = $500

        Wedding Day
        What a special day!! This is a day you will always want to remember. I will capture those special moments from the ceremony to the reception so that you can enjoy the moment. Wedding day coverage includes the ceremony(or pictures at the temple), and reception/celebration. 
        4 hours of coverage = $600 
        6 hours of coverage = $800 
        8 hours of coverage = $1,000

        Portraits 
        These can fit your needs anything from graduation, a new profile picture, to a headshot for your passport. Portraits are normally one-on-one clients with the photographer and are priced out by the hour. If you wanted to do grad or prom date pictures add $40 to the prices listed below. Depending on your need we can shoot at multiple locations.
        1 hour = $100
        2 hours = $220
        3 hours = $330

        Family
        Your family is growing and changing, document your family for photo books, wall decor, and for posterity. Family sessions last about an hour (quick so the kiddos can stay focused). We will start with the group pictures and then do individuals from youngest to oldest. You pick the location, and we can find a time that works with everyone's schedule. If you have more than 6 people please ad $10 a person to the price below. 
        Family Session = $200

      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>
        Hey, my name is Shae!! I am currently based out of Idaho but look for adventure everywhere! I grew up in Canada, and yes, if you listen close you might just hear me say "eh". I served a mission on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and then choose to come back to the states for collage. I meet my husband in class and he has always encouraged me to follow my dreams, and he helps me make them a reality. My amazing husband encouraged me and even bought me a fancy camera, now I live my dream! I am a photographer! I am so grateful that my husband has been so supportive and encouraging as I have developed my skills and spent so much time learning and practicing.

        I attended BYU-I and graduated with a degree in Professional Studies. I took 24 classes (a minor) that were dedicated to taking photos. I've learned so much, ranging from the simple "point and click" to correctly exposing a film camera. 
        This is more than a hobby to me; this profession creates happiness in my life and in the lives of those I take photos for. With years of experience, I am committed to capturing beautiful images of you and your loved ones! No matter what you need/want pictures for I will work to make you look amazing! I try to keep my photo shoots fun and professional. I can be your family photographer for every event from newborn pictures, high school seniors, engagements, weddings, and family pictures every year of the journey. Photos are such a great gift, they bring back memories and allow us to see loved ones after they are gone. I want to help you capture the milestones of life so that you and your family can remember them forever.
