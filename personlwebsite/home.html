            <p class="p2">
                Make the wedding day smoother and easier by getting your formal pictures (Like the first look, just the bride/just the groom, and all the posses with just the couple) out of the way. This allows you to have pictures of yourself in your dress and suit displayed at a reception/celebration on your wedding day. Formals will take about 2-3 hours that can be split between multiple locations of your choice.

If you have more than 6 people please ad $10 a person to the price below.
